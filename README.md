# CallTracker

A C# application using ASP.NET MVC, entity framework, and the SalesForce REST API.  

This application helps to determine the best time a sales person could reach their contact throughout the day based on a simple heuristic.  

Eventually this heuristic may be expanded to take in to account other attributes.
